# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- So far, I feel reasonably confident on this content. It took me a bit to figure out why none of my arrays were displaying when I initially ran my code in terminal, but then I figured out that I hadn't included any put statements. That would do it!

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I do not feel as though I need any additional learning before moving to the next lesson.

# What questions do you have about Arrays?
- At this point, I don't think I know enough to have more array-based questions. I do want to know what it looks like when they're used in apps that I interact with on a daily basis, but I also don't know enough about them yet for that to make any sense to me! However, everything in time, so I'm not too worried.
